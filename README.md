# xTwister: Privacy and Security in Transactions for MultiversX

Welcome to xTwister, where your privacy and security are our top priorities! In the world of MultiversX, transparency and privacy are crucial. That's why we've developed xTwister: a secure and anonymous payment protocol to protect your financial transactions.

## Problem: Lack of Privacy in Public Transactions

As you know, all your transaction history, your $EGLD and $ESDT balance, staking position, the NFTs you own – all of that valuable information is **PUBLIC**. Anyone who knows your herotag or with whom you've exchanged tokens or NFTs could trace all your movements, from the origin to the destination of your funds, even uncover your activities on centralized exchanges (CEX). It can be terrifying, right? These were the rules of the game in Elrond, **until now**.

## Solution: xTwister Smart Contract Mixer

With xTwister, we offer you a simple and secure solution. We use a **Smart Contract Mixer** to ensure your transactions are **100% anonymous**. Here's how it works:

### **Anonymous Deposit**

1. **Connect to the DAPP:**
   Connect your wallet (WALLET A) to our application, select the desired amount, and click "DEPOSIT". Our service creates a secret note that you **MUST** save, as it is the key to withdrawing your funds in the future.

2. **Confirm Your Transaction:**
   Once the transaction is confirmed, our Smart Contract stores the funds and adds the encrypted note (commitment) to the list of deposits. **No one but you** has access to the note or the funds.

3. **Verify Your Transaction:**
   It's **mandatory** to verify the transaction result in the **MultiversX Explorer** to ensure its success.

### **Privacy Score and Relayer Way**

- **Privacy Score:**
  Our approach is similar to a traffic light. Each type of deposit has a score, and the color of the indicator tells you if it's safe to withdraw the funds. Choose an amount with a high Privacy Score to enhance your anonymity.

- **The Relayer Way:**
  We faced the challenge of how to add funds to the anonymous wallet to pay transaction fees. With our **RELAYER** feature, you don't need to do anything. The new wallet will receive the funds without the need to deposit EGLD beforehand, keeping it private and secure.
